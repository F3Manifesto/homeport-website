        Too big to care platforms depend on scarcity of attenton in a
        neverending abundance with the promise of great works. They target us
        with ads we don’t want because as creative consumers we are too far from
        the source materials to make storefronts of our own that just work.
        <br /> <br />
        Craft greatness. Run your own drops. Price the infinite record store
        on-demand. It’s how a free + open verse pays for itself.
