Her steel-toed boots clicked on the pavement.\n\nShe was on a mission.\n\nDecentralized manufacturing in New York City. In hidden workshops beneath the city, fabrics shimmered with arcane beauty, woven from ether and moonbeams. Each item bestows uncanny gifts upon the wearer - invisibility, flight, protection from blades and spells. Where once was just brick and concrete, now swirled portals to other realms, viewable only by those initiated into the fold. Each cloak and tunic was a spell, waiting to be unleashed."
